CPSC 3220 - Project 4

DESIGN

Our program searches the root directory areas, recursively searching for files.
It will attempt to recover deleted files by assuming adjacent free blocks in
the FAT once held pointers to its data.

KNOWN ISSUES

You need to give open() permissions otherwise the crazy default will try to ruin
your project.. But that was fixed

At least one sector of deleted files will be recovered, even if that sector has
been overwritten by another file.
