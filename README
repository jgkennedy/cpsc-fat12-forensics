CPSC3220 - Project 4

DESIGN

We decided to use code to solve the problem. Worked pretty well
Open the fat, iterate through the directory to find the files. If they had been,
they were recovered.

KNOWN ISSUES
You need to give open() permissions otherwise the crazy default will try to ruin
your project.. But that was fixed
